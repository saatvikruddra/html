                            <p>Critics say the rules, due to be voted on this week, could put an end to memes and remixes, and require platforms to pay for linking to news.

                                        Instead of an encyclopaedia entry, visitors to any page on the Italian language Wikipedia were greeted with a statement about the upcoming vote.
                                        
                                        The editors wrote that "Wikipedia itself would be at risk of closing".
                                        
                                        "If the proposal is approved, it may be impossible to share a newspaper article on social networks or find it on a search engine," it said.
